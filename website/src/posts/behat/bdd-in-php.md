# BDD in PHP or “Just Be Hat”

Today is a great day. Why? Because from today we can write Cucumber-like behavior tests in php.

I’ve finished first alpha of Behat. Behat – is behavior driven development framework for php,
based on Cucumber’s Gherkin syntax. It means, that it works with same feature files, Cucumber does
& generate almost the same output, Cucumber does. But inside… Inside it’ modern, beautifull php
5.3 project build on top of:

* Symfony Dependency Injection Container component
* Symfony Event Dispatcher component
* Symfony Console component

It means, Behat very fast, flexible and even beautifull to use right now. Go to official site. Or
check the code on GitHub.
